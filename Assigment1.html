                <h2><li>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</li></h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>First Playthrough: 2017</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This game holds a special place in my heart. Everytime I play this game, I am drawn in by it's sprawling landscapes, thrilling combat, exciting music, and heartwarming story. The game was released seven years ago (2015), but still holds its own against newer releases.

                <h2><li>The Mass Effect Trilogy</li></h2>
                <P><strong>First Playthrough: 2022</strong></P>
                <p>
                    These games are fan-favourites for a reason. The world of Mass-Effect is intensely lore-rich with well-written characters. Playing this game feels like stepping into a completley different universe, one that exists without you. Each game build upon itself, and with the ability to import your decisions from a previous game, it feels as though the smallest decisions can have a butterfly effect.

                <h2><li>God of War (2018)</li></h2>
                <p><strong>First Playthrough: 2019</strong></p>
                <p>
                    It's a story about a god of war and his demi-god son fighting their way to a long-lost realm in Norse mythology. The monsters are huge, but your axe is bigger. Your foes are scary, but so are you. Kratos and his son have the killing efficiency of a steamroller against ants. How would you feel if I told you that this game was really about connection, and rekindling old bonds? Throughout the game, Kratos learns to accept and love his son. While this is happening, the characters around you are also doing the same. Brok and Sindri, two brothers that help you along your journey, overtime learn to put aside past differences and learn to accept each other again. The only characters who are not able to accept and forgive, eventually die.
