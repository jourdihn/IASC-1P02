        <h1>My Favourite Videogames V.2</v></h1> 
        <p>In my previous assignment, I stated that I <span class="italics">love</span> to play video games in my spare time. In this assignment, I will re-create that list, but with proper CSS standards</p>

        <div class="firstList">
            <ol>
                <div>
                    <li>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</li>
                    <p class="listContents">This game holds a special place in my heart. Every time I play, I am drawn in by sprawling landscapes, thrilling combat, exciting music, and a heartwarming story. The game was released seven years ago (2015), but still holds its own against newer releases. It is not surprise to my  friends and family that I am very excited about the news of CDProject Red's plan to release a new trilogy for this franchise. </p>

                <div>
                    <li>The Mass Effect Trilogy</li>
                    <p class="listContents">These games are fan-favourites for a reason. The world of Mass-Effect is intensely lore-rich with well-written characters. Playing this game feels like stepping into a completley different universe, one that exists without you. Each game build upon itself, and with the ability to import your decisions from a previous game, it feels as though the smallest decisions can have a butterfly effect.</p>

                <div>
                    <li>God of War (2018)</li>
                    <p class="listContents">It's a story about a god of war and his demi-god son fighting their way to a long-lost realm in Norse mythology. The monsters are huge, but your axe is bigger. Your foes are scary, but so are you. Kratos and his son have the killing efficiency of a steamroller against ants. How would you feel if I told you that this game was really about connection, and rekindling old bonds? Throughout the game, Kratos learns to accept and love his son. While this is happening, the characters around you are also doing the same. Brok and Sindri, two brothers that help you along your journey, overtime learn to put aside past differences and learn to accept each other again. The only characters who are not able to accept and forgive, eventually die.</p>
